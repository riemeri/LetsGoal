# LetsGoal
This application allows you to create and manage personal goals by assigning importance, due dates, and by tracking your progress towards the completion of the goals. Notes can be added, and categories can also be assigned to goals (though these features haven't been implemented yet). Notes are then highlighted by their importance, and in the future, users will be able to sort goals by importance, date, category, and precentage of completion. 


### Disclaimer
This application was developed for a UI Development class, and as such it was intended as a visual demo. Therefore, a number of the features are incomplete, such as adding notes to goals, setting categories, updating progress, and the menu system. Currently, all development has ceased on this project.
